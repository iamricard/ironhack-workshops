#### Tech by: @kikobeats and @rcsole
#### Tech stack: Angular.js, Sails.js, Database TBD

Kiko will develop a sample API with Sails.js and Ricard will implement the front-end on top of the API. Attendees will be asked to choose front-end or back-end and one at a time they will program in front of everyone a part of either the back-end or the front-end. Everyone can try both but only after each person has passed once through the computer. Only one computer will be used by everyone.

### Introduction to Clojure
#### Expected Date: Sun 3 Aug 2014

#### Tech by: @elreplicante(?), rafadc(?)
#### Tech stack: Functional languages, Clojure and Hello World

I've always been curious about functional languages. I know that JavaScript have little parts of functional principles, but I would like know more about this (And @rafadc said me that should try Clojure)
